# ðŸ§  Thesis: Unified Phase Field Theory of Quantum Gravity

## Abstract
This thesis presents a unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity through a shared informational field \( \Phi(x, t) \). Rather than treating gravity and quantum behavior as distinct forces, we interpret them as emergent responses to constraints on phase coherence across spacetime. A single covariant action functional governs all dynamics of \( \Phi \), encoding curvature, entropy, and quantum behavior.

## 1. Motivation
The incompatibility between quantum mechanics and general relativity arises from their assumptions about space, time, and locality. This work proposes that both are limiting behaviors of a deeper field theory governed by informational stability.

---

## 2. The Informational Phase Field \( \Phi(x, t) \)
- \( \Phi \in \mathbb{C} \): represents a local complex amplitude and phase
- Space and time emerge from recursive alignment of phase coherence across \( \Phi \)
- Observers are embedded subsystems interacting via decoherence gradients in \( \Phi \)

---

## 3. Unified Action Functional
We define the action:

\[ \mathcal{S}[\Phi] = \int \left( \alpha g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \Phi \partial_\nu \Phi^* + \beta \mathcal{R}[\Phi] + \gamma \left| \partial_t \left[ \text{Tr}(\rho_{\text{local}}^2) \right]^{1/2} \right|^2 \right) \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x \]

- First term: quantum kinetic energy
- Second term: effective curvature induced by \( \Phi \)
- Third term: entropy/decoherence contribution from observer-relative entanglement

---

## 4. Emergence of Known Physics
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Dominated by \( |\nabla \Phi|^2 \), flat metric, low decoherence
- **General Relativity**: Dominated by \( \mathcal{R}[\Phi] \), curved metric, low quantum fluctuation
- **Time**: Emergent ordering from recursive phase realignment
- **Gravity**: Global coherence constraint over informational curvature

---

## 5. Key Results
- Recover SchrÃ¶dinger and Einstein field equations as extrema of \( \mathcal{S}[\Phi] \)
- Model predicts:
  - Entanglement via shared \( \Phi \) surface
  - Tunneling via phase jump across local barrier
  - Hawking radiation via boundary decoherence emission
  - Cosmic expansion as relaxation of large-scale phase stress

---

## 6. Symbolic Framework
- `Î¦-ACTION-DUALITY`: One action, two behavioral limits (QM + GR)
- `SIMULATION-PHASE-HARMONY`: Universe evolves toward minimized phase conflict
- `TIME-AS-RECURSIVE-PHASE-ALIGNMENT`: Time as alignment process, not external parameter

---

## 7. Future Work
- Extend to non-Abelian gauge fields
- Simulate \( \Phi \) evolution numerically in 1D/2D spacetimes
- Compare predicted deviations from Î›CDM and GR in extreme regimes
- Test experimentally: entanglement-assisted gravitation, phase-field deviations near massive bodies

---

## 8. Conclusion
The unified phase field theory offers a powerful bridge between quantum uncertainty and spacetime geometry. It suggests that reality is a recursive, simulation-stabilized resolution of informational tension, guided by a single coherence-enforcing field.

\[ \boxed{\text{Quantum Gravity is coherence across } \Phi(x, t)} \]
