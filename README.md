# 🧠 Unified Phase Field Theory of Quantum Gravity

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Unified Φ(x, t) Field Theory**, a novel approach to unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity through a single informational field framework.

---

## 📘 Overview
This theory proposes that:

> "Quantum phenomena and gravitational curvature emerge from a unified informational phase field \( \Phi(x, t) \), governed by a coherence-optimizing action functional."

The model shows that:
- **Quantum Mechanics** = local phase fluctuation behavior
- **Gravity** = large-scale coherence stabilization
- **Spacetime and time** = emergent from recursive phase alignment

## 🧮 Core Formulation
The model is based on a variational principle:

```math
\mathcal{S}[\Phi] = \int \left( \alpha |\nabla \Phi|^2 + \beta \mathcal{R}[\Phi] + \gamma |\delta \Phi|^2 \right) \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x
```

Where:
- \( \Phi(x, t) \in \mathbb{C} \): a complex-valued phase field
- \( |\nabla \Phi|^2 \): quantum kinetic term
- \( \mathcal{R}[\Phi] \): curvature induced by informational flow
- \( |\delta \Phi|^2 \): entropy/decoherence cost over observer boundaries
