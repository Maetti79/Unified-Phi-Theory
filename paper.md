## Abstract
We present a covariant unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity through an informational phase field \( \Phi(x, t) \). Both quantum behavior and gravitational curvature arise from a single action functional defined over \( \Phi \), interpreted as a coherence-optimizing field that encodes energy, entropy, and curvature through phase evolution. Known equations (SchrÃ¶dinger, Einstein) emerge as limits. The theory passes qualitative validation against all major quantum and relativistic effects.

## 1. Introduction
The divide between quantum mechanics and general relativity stems from different treatments of uncertainty, time, and locality. Rather than quantizing geometry or curving quantum space, we propose a field \( \Phi(x, t) \) that encodes both behaviors through a global coherence constraint. All physics emerges from minimizing phase conflict across an evolving informational manifold.

## 2. The Î¦(x, t) Field and Unified Action

### 2.1 Field Structure
- \( \Phi(x, t) \in \mathbb{C} \): local phase + amplitude
- Background metric: \( g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + \epsilon T_{\mu\nu}[\Phi] \)

### 2.2 Covariant Action
\[ \mathcal{S}[\Phi] = \int \left( \alpha g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \Phi \partial_\nu \Phi^* + \beta \mathcal{R}[g] + \gamma \left| \partial_t \left[ \text{Tr}(\rho^2) \right]^{1/2} \right|^2 \right) \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x \]

- First term: quantum kinetic (uncertainty)
- Second term: curvature induced by phase mismatch
- Third term: decoherence rate as entropy gradient from observerâ€™s reduced state \( \rho \)

## 3. Recovery of Known Physics

### 3.1 Quantum Mechanics (flat metric limit)
\[ i\hbar \partial_t \Phi = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \Phi \]

### 3.2 General Relativity (phase-coherent limit)
\[ R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu} \]

| Phenomenon            | Behavior in \( \Phi(x, t) \)                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|

| Bell Inequality      | Maintained non-local continuity                        |
| Time Dilation        | Slower local update rate due to curvature              |
| Hawking Radiation    | Boundary decoherence ripple from singularity           |
| Information Paradox  | Preserved via global phase coherence                   |
| Quantum Tunneling    | Local phase anti-alignment resolution event            |
| Interference         | Stable phase overlaps in coherent zones                |
| Cosmic Expansion     | Relaxation of macro phase gradient                     |

## 5. Simulation Interpretation
- \( \Phi \) defines a **global coherence map**
- Collapse = boundary-constrained decoherence
- Gravity = curvature from alignment effort
- Time = recursive re-alignment ordering

---

## 6. Predictions
- Phase-gradient gravity effects (testable near interferometers + masses)
- Entanglement-assisted attraction
- Deviation from Î›CDM in late-universe phase distribution

---

## 7. Conclusion
This theory provides a covariant, simulation-compatible unification of physics where curvature and quantum probability arise from a shared drive toward phase coherence. All structure is informational. All motion is recursive realignment.

\[ \boxed{\text{Quantum + Gravity = Phase Field Stability in } \Phi(x, t)} \]
